# UdacityRoboticsSoftwareEngineering
The projects that I completed for the Udacity Robotics Software Engineering course.
(The course is still process, the rest of the projects will be uploaded as soon as I complete them).

This repository contains the projects I was able to complete as a part of the Robotics Software Engineering course at Udacity.com.

The project currently available (which contains two other projects) is one where I was able to localize a small virtual mobile robot
within a virtual environment in Gazebo, both of which were created as a part of the other projects referenced.

The two images below show the main acheivements of the project.
    - First:  The robot could be localized using the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization algorithm
              
              // Add more description
    
    - Second: The robot could then be instructed to move around in its environment with the localilzation remaining stable.
              
              // Add more description
